# Distributed Manager Refactoring

## Overview

The distributed job manager has been completely refactored from a monolithic 1500+ line file into a clean, component-based architecture that properly inherits from `BaseJobManager` and provides better job status tracking.

## Key Issues Fixed

### 1. Job Status Tracking
**Problem**: The old system didn't properly catch job failures in real-time. For example:
- Task 114 failed (CUDA error) but wasn't detected until post-processing
- Task 115 completed successfully but couldn't override local failed directory

**Solution**: New `JobMonitor` component provides:
- Real-time status monitoring (every 2 seconds)
- Status validation against actual task directories (`task_info.txt` files)
- Immediate detection of status changes with callbacks

### 2. Directory Override Issues  
**Problem**: Completion runs couldn't properly override existing failed task directories

**Solution**: New `ResultCollector` component provides:
- Smart directory override logic for completion runs
- Priority system: COMPLETED > FAILED/CANCELLED > RUNNING > UNKNOWN
- Automatic backup creation for important overrides
- Proper cleanup of unused source directories

### 3. Code Structure and Maintainability
**Problem**: Single 1500+ line file with mixed responsibilities

**Solution**: Clean component-based architecture:
```
BaseDistributedManager (inherits from BaseJobManager)
â”œâ”€â”€ JobDistributor - handles job distribution across sources
â”œâ”€â”€ JobMonitor - real-time status tracking with validation  
â”œâ”€â”€ ResultCollector - result collection and normalization
â””â”€â”€ DistributedJobManager - orchestrates all components
```

## New Architecture

### Component Breakdown

#### `BaseDistributedManager`
- Properly inherits from `BaseJobManager`
- Provides signal handling and cleanup
- Abstract base for distributed managers

#### `JobDistributor` 
- Handles job queuing and distribution
- Supports multiple distribution strategies (round-robin, least-loaded, capability-based)
- Built-in retry logic and failure handling
- Source failsafe (auto-disable sources with high failure rates)

#### `JobMonitor`
- **Real-time status monitoring** (every 2 seconds)
- **Status validation** against actual task directories
- Callback system for status changes
- Tracks job counts and statistics

#### `ResultCollector`
- Continuous result collection from remote sources
- Smart result normalization with conflict resolution
- Directory override logic for completion runs
- Scripts and logs collection

#### `DistributedJobManager`
- Main orchestrator that coordinates all components
- Progress tracking with Rich progress bars
- Proper async/await architecture
- Clean setup/teardown lifecycle

## Migration Guide

### For Developers

**Old Import:**
```python
from hpc_sweep_manager.core.distributed.ditributed_manager import DistributedJobManager
```

**New Import:**
```python
from hpc_sweep_manager.core.distributed import DistributedJobManager
```

The public API remains the same, but internal implementation is completely refactored.

### Key Improvements for Users

1. **Better Error Handling**: Job failures are detected immediately, not just during post-processing
2. **Smarter Completion Runs**: Failed tasks can be properly overridden with successful results
3. **Real-time Status**: See job status changes as they happen
4. **Better Progress Tracking**: Rich progress bars with detailed status information
5. **More Reliable**: Component isolation means failures in one area don't break others

## Real-time Status Tracking

The new system provides immediate feedback:

```
ðŸ”„ Job status change detected: local_sweep_001 (local) RUNNING -> FAILED
ðŸ”„ Job status change detected: remote_blossom_002 (blossom) RUNNING -> COMPLETED
```

This means you'll know about failures immediately instead of discovering them during post-processing.

## Directory Override Logic

For completion runs, the system now intelligently handles directory conflicts:

1. **COMPLETED** tasks always override any other status
2. **FAILED/CANCELLED** tasks can override **RUNNING** tasks
3. Existing **COMPLETED** tasks are preserved (no unnecessary work)
4. Automatic backups are created when overriding important results

## Component Testing

Each component can now be tested in isolation:

```python
# Test job distribution separately
distributor = JobDistributor(sources, strategy=DistributionStrategy.ROUND_ROBIN)

# Test status monitoring separately  
monitor = JobMonitor(sweep_dir, sources)

# Test result collection separately
collector = ResultCollector(sweep_dir, sources)
```

## Backwards Compatibility

The old `ditributed_manager.py` is deprecated but still available for backwards compatibility:

```python
# This will work but shows a deprecation warning
from hpc_sweep_manager.core.distributed import LegacyDistributedJobManager
```

## Performance Improvements

- **Real-time monitoring**: 2-second status check interval (vs. 5-second in old system)
- **Parallel operations**: Components run concurrently 
- **Better resource usage**: No more polling everything constantly
- **Faster failure detection**: Immediate status validation instead of post-processing only

This refactoring provides a much more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly distributed execution system.
